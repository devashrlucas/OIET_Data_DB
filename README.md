# Database: OIET Data
Data from the Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker as a PostgreSQL database.

# Prerequisites

### Local
  For Mac users: please remove the '.DS_Store' file from the main directory.
If you have already done so globally, you can ignore the following set of instructions.
1) Open your preferred command line interface
2) In command line, run: `cd /path/to/OIET_DATA_DB`
3) In command line, run:` find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete`

# Entity Relationship Diagram
Below is an ERD I created using [dbdesigner.net](https://www.dbdesigner.net/). The majority of the database design was inherited from how the original data files are formatted. This ERD primarily documents the existing structure. A PDF version of the diagram is also available in the `docs` folder.
